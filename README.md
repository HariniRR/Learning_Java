# Concepts_of_Java ☕
 
Welcome to my Java Practice Repository!  
This is where I’m learning and improving my Java skills by writing code, solving problems, and building mini-projects. The goal is to understand the core concepts of Java through hands-on practice  with Eclipse IDE 😊.

## 🚀 What I'm Doing  
The main topics I'm focus and working on:

- ✅ Java syntax, basic concepts and program structure
- ✅ Data types: primitive, non-primitive 
- ✅ Control flow statements: if-else, switch, loops  
- ✅ Collections:ArrayList, HashSet, TreeMap Stack, Queue, etc.
- ✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism  
- ✅ Exception handling: pre defined and user defined exceptions   
- ✅ Practice exercises and simple Java programs
