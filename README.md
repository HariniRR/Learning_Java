# Concepts_of_Java â˜•
 
Welcome to my Java Practice Repository!  
This is where Iâ€™m learning and improving my Java skills by writing code, solving problems, and building mini-projects. The goal is to understand the core concepts of Java through hands-on practice with Eclipse IDE ðŸ˜Š.
Iâ€™m currently working on the Java topics regularly and adding new tasks and practice files as I learn. This repository will keep growing with my progress and learning journey.

## ðŸš€ What I'm Doing  
The main topics I'm focus and working on:

- âœ… Java syntax, basic concepts and program structure
- âœ… Data types: primitive, non-primitive 
- âœ… Control flow statements: if-else, switch, loops  
- âœ… Collections:ArrayList, HashSet, TreeMap Stack, Queue, etc.
- âœ… Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism  
- âœ… Exception handling: pre defined and user defined exceptions   
- âœ… Data Streams: using byte and character streams
